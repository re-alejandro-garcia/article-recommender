Alex Powell,Level Up Coding,5 Must Know Languages for Data Science and Machine Learning,"Many programmers’ first language is Python. It’s a high-level, general-purpose programming language with hundreds of thousands of open source packages. Python is used for game development, data analysis, machine learning, finance, and just about every application you can think of. The Pythonic style is marked by list comprehensions and various kinds of syntactic sugar.",Aug 11,7 min read,https://levelup.gitconnected.com/5-must-know-languages-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-c909692e4a96,A Beginner’s Guide.

Towards AI Editorial Team,Towards AI,This AI newsletter is all you need #7,"This week’s newsletter iteration is all about how AI has been used to help society. As you know, there are many, many possible use cases of AI, and more are discovered daily. Fortunately, many of these use cases help take research forward in important fields like medicine or climate science to improve our quality of life. Last week, DeepMind announced that they predicted structures for nearly all cataloged proteins known to science. What does this mean? Researchers can already try new opportunities and use AlphaFold (DeepMind’s model and database) to advance their work on important issues, including sustainability, food insecurity, and neglected diseases. This focus on high impact is becoming more and more common, as a new model called ProtGPT2 is now capable of designing new proteins capable of stable folding. This area of research is no longer only accessible to big and heavily financed organizations! This protein folding progress is mainly thanks to the similarity between proteins and language. As they mention, “Natural languages and proteins are actually similar in structure. Amino acids arrange themselves in a multitude of combinations to form structures that have specific functions in the living organism — similar to the way words form sentences in different combinations that express certain facts.”",Aug 10,5 min read,https://pub.towardsai.net/this-ai-newsletter-is-all-you-need-7-af749790e33b,
