## Description

I enjoy reading and keeping up with the latest news and tools in the tech world. The problem is that there are many websites that offer reading material, from big article providers such as Medium to small personal blogs. Keeping up with the latest reading material from all these websites can be a time consuming task. One service that has helped me personally are Medium's daily emails containing recommended articles based on my reading history. However, even these emails tend to contain far more articles that are irrelevant to my preferences than those that are relevant.

With this project I aim to solve this problem by creating an application that will send out a daily email containing links to the latest articles from all over the web, but only those that I will actually read and are relevant to my interests. At the time of writing this I will develop this application to collect only links to Medium articles, but I intend to add other providers in due time.

Machine learning will be used to determine which articles should be recommended and automation tools will allow for sending out a daily email. Periodic re-training of the model will allow for the application to keep up with changing user preferences. Finally, the service will be entirely email based so changing preferences and settings can be done through an email.
