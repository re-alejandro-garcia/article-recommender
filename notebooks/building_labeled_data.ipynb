    "## What Data do we Need?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing this I have two sources of data: Medium (web scraping and API) and News API. We're going to be building two separate models: one to label the topic of each article and another to recommend articles based on a user's preferences. The Medium API allows us to get the topic label for each article so we'll use this API to build a dataset with topic labels. To create a good balance we'll use both the Medium and News APIs to build a dataset of articles that will be labeled with user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labeling the user preferences is going to be a time consuming process. These labels will be created manually by having different users simply go through the dataset and choose which articles they would find interesting to read. This process obviously won't be shown here, but the final result can be seen in the exploration notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the Topic Label Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we'll go over the steps involved in using the Medium API to build a dataset of articles labeled with topics that each article is categorized under. First though, we must decide on a list of broad topics to cover. We will certainly not be able to cover all the possible topics that could be labeled, but we want to try to cover a wide range of topics. It will be important to keep in mind that we will need to take measures to continue to re-train the topic labeling model periodically in order to be capable of labeling topics that for now will be unseen. For now we'll gather articles covering the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. data science\n",
    "1. machine learning\n",
    "1. programming\n",
    "1. social media\n",
    "1. self\n",
    "1. philosophy\n",
    "1. gaming\n",
    "1. politics\n",
    "1. health\n",
    "1. psychology\n",
    "1. work\n",
    "1. productivity\n",
    "1. parenting\n",
    "1. history\n",
    "1. cryptocurrency\n",
    "1. science\n",
    "1. relationships\n",
    "1. food\n",
    "1. technology\n",
    "1. business\n",
    "\n",
    "Again this is obviously not a comprehensive list of topic categories, but it will provide a good starting point and most importantly will help in exploration to determine what relates articles in each topic category to each other. Here we have 20 different topics. The Medium API will allow me to gather data for 200 articles. So we'll grab 10 articles for each topic. We'll simply grab the latest articles published."
