    "### Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the API would definitely make things easier, but it comes with some very significant limitations. First from the work done above we can see that for each article we collect data on the API will make a call. This means that if, for instance, we wanted to get the latest 25 articles for 5 different topics this would amount to 125 API calls which is half the monthly allotment of 250. Even using a smarter algorithm to ensure we don't make more calls than necessary we would still probably expend the monthly free tier allotment within a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching to a paid tier is an option. The next tier up would cost 4.99 per month and give 1,250 API calls per month. This might be enough, but it comes with the downside of having to pay for the API. Not to mention that it might possibly still not be enough calls as the application begins to scale to a larger size. The API with the free tier would probably be good enough if this application was kept to a small scope, such as only pulling article data for 2 or 3 different topics. This would not make for a very useful application though so we may need to explore alternative solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be worthwhile to design and build a package that utilizes the API just in case later on it is discovered that the API is necessary.\n",
