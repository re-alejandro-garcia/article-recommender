    "### Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the API would definitely make things easier, but it comes with some very significant limitations. First from the work done above we can see that for each article we collect data on the API will make a call. This means that if, for instance, we wanted to get the latest 25 articles for 5 different topics this would amount to 125 API calls which is half the monthly allotment of 250. Even using a smarter algorithm to ensure we don't make more calls than necessary we would still probably expend the monthly free tier allotment within a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching to a paid tier is an option. The next tier up would cost 4.99 per month and give 1,250 API calls per month. This might be enough, but it comes with the downside of having to pay for the API. Not to mention that it might possibly still not be enough calls as the application begins to scale to a larger size. The API with the free tier would probably be good enough if this application was kept to a small scope, such as only pulling article data for 2 or 3 different topics. This would not make for a very useful application though so we may need to explore alternative solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be worthwhile to design and build a package that utilizes the API just in case later on it is discovered that the API is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acquiring Article Data Through Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "For scraping the data we need there are a few things to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is possible to structure the URL in such a way that we can get the latest articles, but without JavaScript enabled we only get 10 articles. By simply counting the number of articles published in a single day for a single topic we can expect that for most topics and publications there will likely be more than 10 articles published per day. This means we would either need to run the web scraping script multiple times a day or use a dynamic web scraping library like Selenium. I know from experience that Selenium does not play well with Crontab so this could be problematic.\n",
    "2. Getting the latest articles for a publication shouldn't be too much of an issue. Getting the latest articles for a specific topic could be problematic. Searching for a specific through the main medium site provides unusual results (the articles don't seem to be in order of most recent, articles of varying related topics seem to be returned, I also seem to get different results for Chrome and Safari).\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point I believe it is best to move forward with the solution that will be best given the limitations present. So we will only pull the latest articles for given publications and not for specific topics (at least not until this weird issue with the return results is fixed). To accomplish this task we will need requests and Beautiful Soup."

We are not able to get topic information for each article (we may need to use the API for this purpose and build a model to predict topics). Because we can only scrape 10 articles per publication we may need to run the web scraping script multiple times a day in order to keep up with the latest articles. Otherwise at some point in the future I can explore how to accomplish this with Selenium in order to deal with this issue.\n",

Namely, this API allows for gathering article data from many different sources, over 80,000 according to the website. While there most likely will be some opportunities to add in other sources through web scraping/APIs using the News API will cover a wide range of online sources that will help to deliver content for the article recommender project. Here in this section we'll look at how this API can be used."

    "The News API will be very helpful for gathering article data from a very large variety of sources. A quick test (not shown here) shows that articles can be pulled from Medium using the News API, but only a few results will come from Medium and it is dependent on the search query appearing in the article. That being said, I believe the already existing code for gathering article data from Medium publications will be best for that source especially it allows for gathering additional information such as read time. While some of the data acquired from the News API is rather messy, I believe that providing web scraping solutions to gather additional/cleaner data would be far too time consuming of a task and we are better off using what is provided through the News API."
